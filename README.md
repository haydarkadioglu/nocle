# Nocle - Noisy Reducer with AI

This project implements a noise reduction AI model that processes audio files to reduce background noise. It utilizes deep learning techniques to enhance audio quality, making it suitable for various applications in audio processing. The project includes a Jupyter notebook for predictions, sample audio files for testing, and necessary scripts for model handling.


## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook `make_predict.ipynb` to start using the noise reduction model. You can load your own audio files and see the results of the noise reduction process.
